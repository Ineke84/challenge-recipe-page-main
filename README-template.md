## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Free version of the challenge - no figma files

### Time spend

Devided over several days/weeks: 7 hours

### What I learned

At first I thought it was an easy one, but some challenges where:

- The heading image on mobile screen wide and on desktop an image inside a box

- Vertically centering the list item marker

- Still insecure about semantic html

### Continued development

I did initially start with the desktop version of de page and then realised I had to change especially the header image a lot for mobile. It would have been better to start inmediately with mobile and then change things for desktop. Important learning for next projects.
